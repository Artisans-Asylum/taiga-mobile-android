## Tools
It is recommended to use latest version of Android Studio

## Tests
Tests need local Taiga instance to run. 
Local instance is created and stopped automatically for every `Test` gradle task, so usually there is no need to start and stop Taiga instance manually.
See [taiga-test-instance](taiga-test-instance) folder for more info about helper scripts and configurations.
