# TaigaMobile
This is unofficial android app for [taiga.io](https://www.taiga.io/) (agile project management system) built with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) (brand new UI toolkit from Google). Project is still under development, so new features will be added in future.
