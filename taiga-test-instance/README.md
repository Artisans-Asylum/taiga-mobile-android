## Credits
Took this from [taiga-docker repository](https://github.com/kaleidos-ventures/taiga-docker/) and tinkered a little bit.

## Usage
You need `docker` and `docker-compose` to be installed. In order to run commands you need to `cd` to this directory.  
There are following options:  
* `launch-taiga.sh` - creates (if does not exist) and runs Taiga instance
* `stop-taiga.sh` - stops running instance
* `clear-taiga.sh` - stops and clears all data (removes all volumes)
